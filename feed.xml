      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the good fortune of being able to speak at Fluent Conf 2014. While that video is forthcoming, I also had the unique opportunity to be interviewed by Brian McDonald about the JavaScript framework wars. I felt like the interview went really well; it was just a pleasant conversation I had with Brian that happen to be filmed. If you’d like to see, I’ve embedded it below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was back in January (2014) when I had the good opportunity to be a co-organizer for the Ski PHP conference in Salt Lake City, UT. In addition to helping organize, I also had the opportunity to speak about Grunt.js with a back-end flavor to it. It was a fun 50 minute talk to give. Check it out below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Null to Node 2013 Lesson 4</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2013, a good friend of mine, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thom801&quot;&gt;Thom Allen&lt;/a&gt;, and I decided to teach a class called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nulltonode.com/&quot;&gt;Null to Node&lt;/a&gt; so that people could learn to code. It was a mild success but it was great for me because I had the the opportunity to speak for several hours to large-ish groups of people. I only took one screencast of those lessons but I’m happy to share it here below. By the way, it’s pretty long and you can’t always here me. I wasn’t wearing a microphone and you can only hear me when I’m next to the computer. Sorry!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluent Conf 2013: Lightning Talk</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was in May of 2013 where I gave my first real talk at a conference. It was an Ignite talk. Ignite, for those who don’t know, is a format where you have 20 slides that rotate automatically every 20 seconds. It’s both a fun and a challenging way to give a presentation. I practiced a lot but that didn’t stop me from being incredibly nervous. It was still a great experience. Check it out below.&lt;/p&gt;
