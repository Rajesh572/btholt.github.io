This essentially means he gets paid to use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to help you connect to the world around you, gain deep and meaningful insight, and look at cat pictures for hours. When not saving the world one line of JavaScript at time, Brian loves to ski, mountain bike, trail run, and hang out with his wife and Havanese puppy.
