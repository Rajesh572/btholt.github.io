Back in 2013, a good friend of mine, [Thom Allen](https://twitter.com/thom801), and I decided to teach a class called [Null to Node](http://www.nulltonode.com) so that people could learn to code. It was a mild success but it was great for me because I had the the opportunity to speak for several hours to large-ish groups of people. I only took one screencast of those lessons but I'm happy to share it here below. By the way, it's pretty long and you can't always here me. I wasn't wearing a microphone and you can only hear me when I'm next to the computer. Sorry!
