I had the good fortune of being able to speak at Fluent Conf 2014. While that video is forthcoming, I also had the unique opportunity to be interviewed by Brian McDonald about the JavaScript framework wars. I felt like the interview went really well; it was just a pleasant conversation I had with Brian that happen to be filmed. If you'd like to see, I've embedded it below.
